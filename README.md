# Distributed Systems

This project is for the course of Distributed Systems, in the first assignment we made a Framework that will be responsible to send and retrieve data(messages, video & images).

## Run the project

To run the project, you can simple clone the repository and run it in IntelliJ.

You have to run 3 BrokerImp in different terminals so you have to check in configurations `Allow Multiple Instances` and insert as Argument 1,2,3 for each BrokerImp, then you have to run like BrokerImp three UserNodes in different terminals and same arguments.

After initialization of BrokerImp and UserNodes then just select the topic and the action that you want for the selected topic.

    1. If you want to send a video in a topic copy past the absolute path.
    2. If you want to send a video in a topic copy past the absolute path. 
    3. If you want to send message in a topic just type your message and hit enter.
    4. Reading the conversation will recieve from broker only that messages that wasn't stored localy on your machine.
    5. To register in a topic you have to select it when you choose the topic it is the last choice always, then type the topic that you want. Be carefull to be correct!

On the terminal of BrokerImp and UserNode it will display you some messages to understand the flow of Framework.
